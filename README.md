# SEP-Restaurant-Reviewer
This is a group project done for educational purposes. The webapp is intended to be used for reviewing local restaurants, and for publication in a local newspaper (I've just added this to test)

NOTES For Operation:
This application was designed to run on an AMP stack (Apache2, MySQL, PHP).
